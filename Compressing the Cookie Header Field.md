The Cookie header field [COOKIE] uses a semi-colon (";") to delimit cookie-pairs (or "crumbs"). This header field doesn't follow the list construction rules in HTTP (see [RFC7230], Section 3.2.2), which prevents cookie-pairs from being separated into different name-value pairs. This can significantly reduce compression efficiency as individual cookie-pairs are updated.

To allow for better compression efficiency, the Cookie header field MAY be split into separate header fields, each with one or more cookie-pairs. If there are multiple Cookie header fields after decompression, these MUST be concatenated into a single octet string using the two-octet delimiter of 0x3B, 0x20 (the ASCII string "; ") before being passed into a non-HTTP/2 context, such as an HTTP/1.1 connection, or a generic HTTP server application.

Therefore, the following two lists of Cookie header fields are semantically equivalent.

	 cookie: a=b; c=d; e=f
	
	 cookie: a=b
	 cookie: c=d
	 cookie: e=f
