HTTP header fields carry information as a series of key-value pairs. For a listing of registered HTTP headers, see the "Message Header Field" registry maintained at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers>.

Just as in HTTP/1.x, header field names are strings of ASCII characters that are compared in a case-insensitive fashion. However, header field names MUST be converted to lowercase prior to their encoding in HTTP/2. A request or response containing uppercase header field names MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).
