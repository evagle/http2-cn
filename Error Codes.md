Error codes are 32-bit fields that are used in RST_STREAM and GOAWAY frames to convey the reasons for the stream or connection error.

Error codes share a common code space. Some error codes apply only to either streams or the entire connection and have no defined semantics in the other context.

The following error codes are defined:

**NO_ERROR (0x0):**
The associated condition is not a result of an error. For example, a 
GOAWAY might include this code to indicate graceful shutdown of a connection.

**PROTOCOL_ERROR (0x1):**
The endpoint detected an unspecific protocol error. This error is for use when a more specific error code is not available.

**INTERNAL_ERROR (0x2):**
The endpoint encountered an unexpected internal error.

**FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (0x3):**
The endpoint detected that its peer violated the flow-control protocol.

**SETTINGS_TIMEOUT (0x4):**
The endpoint sent a SETTINGS frame but did not receive a response in a timely manner. See Section 6.5.3 ("Settings Synchronization").

**STREAM_CLOSED (0x5):**
The endpoint received a frame after a stream was half-closed.

**FRAME_SIZE_ERROR (0x6):**
The endpoint received a frame with an invalid size.

**REFUSED_STREAM (0x7):**
The endpoint refused the stream prior to performing any application processing (see Section 8.1.4 for details).

**CANCEL (0x8):**
Used by the endpoint to indicate that the stream is no longer needed.

**COMPRESSION_ERROR (0x9):**
The endpoint is unable to maintain the header compression context for the connection.

**CONNECT_ERROR (0xa):**
The connection established in response to a CONNECT request (Section 8.3) was reset or abnormally closed.

**ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (0xb):**
The endpoint detected that its peer is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load.

**INADEQUATE_SECURITY (0xc):**
The underlying transport has properties that do not meet minimum security requirements (see Section 9.2).

**HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED (0xd):**
The endpoint requires that HTTP/1.1 be used instead of HTTP/2.

Unknown or unsupported error codes MUST NOT trigger any special behavior. These MAY be treated by an implementation as being equivalent to INTERNAL_ERROR.
