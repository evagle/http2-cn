HTTP/2 allows a server to pre-emptively send (or "push") responses (along with corresponding "promised" requests) to a client in association with a previous client-initiated request. This can be useful when the server knows the client will need to have those responses available in order to fully process the response to the original request.

A client can request that server push be disabled, though this is negotiated for each hop independently. The SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH setting can be set to 0 to indicate that server push is disabled.

Promised requests MUST be cacheable (see [RFC7231], Section 4.2.3), MUST be safe (see [RFC7231], Section 4.2.1), and MUST NOT include a request body. Clients that receive a promised request that is not cacheable, that is not known to be safe, or that indicates the presence of a request body MUST reset the promised stream with a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR. Note this could result in the promised stream being reset if the client does not recognize a newly defined method as being safe.

Pushed responses that are cacheable (see [RFC7234], Section 3) can be stored by the client, if it implements an HTTP cache. Pushed responses are considered successfully validated on the origin server (e.g., if the "no-cache" cache response directive is present ([RFC7234], Section 5.2.2)) while the stream identified by the promised stream ID is still open.

Pushed responses that are not cacheable MUST NOT be stored by any HTTP cache. They MAY be made available to the application separately.

The server MUST include a value in the :authority pseudo-header field for which the server is authoritative (see Section 10.1). A client MUST treat a PUSH_PROMISE for which the server is not authoritative as a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

An intermediary can receive pushes from the server and choose not to forward them on to the client. In other words, how to make use of the pushed information is up to that intermediary. Equally, the intermediary might choose to make additional pushes to the client, without any action taken by the server.

A client cannot push. Thus, servers MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE frame as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR. Clients MUST reject any attempt to change the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH setting to a value other than 0 by treating the message as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.
