HTTP/2 removes support for the 101 (Switching Protocols) informational status code ([RFC7231], Section 6.2.2).

The semantics of 101 (Switching Protocols) aren't applicable to a multiplexed protocol. Alternative protocols are able to use the same mechanisms that HTTP/2 uses to negotiate their use (see Section 3).
