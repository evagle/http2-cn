HTTP/2 relies on the HTTP/1.1 definition of authority for determining whether a server is authoritative in providing a given response (see [RFC7230], Section 9.1). This relies on local name resolution for the "http" URI scheme and the authenticated server identity for the "https" scheme (see [RFC2818], Section 3).
