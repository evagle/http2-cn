The HTTP/2 header field encoding allows the expression of names that are not valid field names in the Internet Message Syntax used by HTTP/1.1. Requests or responses containing invalid header field names MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6). An intermediary therefore cannot translate an HTTP/2 request or response containing an invalid field name into an HTTP/1.1 message.

Similarly, HTTP/2 allows header field values that are not valid. While most of the values that can be encoded will not alter header field parsing, carriage return (CR, ASCII 0xd), line feed (LF, ASCII 0xa), and the zero character (NUL, ASCII 0x0) might be exploited by an attacker if they are translated verbatim. Any request or response that contains a character not permitted in a header field value MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6). Valid characters are defined by the field-content ABNF rule in Section 3.2 of [RFC7230].
