This section shows HTTP/1.1 requests and responses, with illustrations of equivalent HTTP/2 requests and responses.

An HTTP GET request includes request header fields and no payload body and is therefore transmitted as a single HEADERS frame, followed by zero or more CONTINUATION frames containing the serialized block of request header fields. The HEADERS frame in the following has both the END_HEADERS and END_STREAM flags set; no CONTINUATION frames are sent.

	 GET /resource HTTP/1.1           HEADERS
	 Host: example.org          ==>     + END_STREAM
	 Accept: image/jpeg                 + END_HEADERS
	                                      :method = GET
	                                      :scheme = https
	                                      :path = /resource
	                                      host = example.org
	                                      accept = image/jpeg
Similarly, a response that includes only response header fields is transmitted as a HEADERS frame (again, followed by zero or more CONTINUATION frames) containing the serialized block of response header fields.

	 HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified        HEADERS
	 ETag: "xyzzy"              ==>     + END_STREAM
	 Expires: Thu, 23 Jan ...           + END_HEADERS
	                                      :status = 304
	                                      etag = "xyzzy"
	                                      expires = Thu, 23 Jan ...
An HTTP POST request that includes request header fields and payload data is transmitted as one HEADERS frame, followed by zero or more CONTINUATION frames containing the request header fields, followed by one or more DATA frames, with the last CONTINUATION (or HEADERS) frame having the END_HEADERS flag set and the final DATA frame having the END_STREAM flag set:

	 POST /resource HTTP/1.1          HEADERS
	 Host: example.org          ==>     - END_STREAM
	 Content-Type: image/jpeg           - END_HEADERS
	 Content-Length: 123                  :method = POST
	                                      :path = /resource
	 {binary data}                        :scheme = https
	
	                                  CONTINUATION
	                                    + END_HEADERS
	                                      content-type = image/jpeg
	                                      host = example.org
	                                      content-length = 123
	
	                                  DATA
	                                    + END_STREAM
	                                  {binary data}
Note that data contributing to any given header field could be spread between header block fragments. The allocation of header fields to frames in this example is illustrative only.

A response that includes header fields and payload data is transmitted as a HEADERS frame, followed by zero or more CONTINUATION frames, followed by one or more DATA frames, with the last DATA frame in the sequence having the END_STREAM flag set:

	 HTTP/1.1 200 OK                  HEADERS
	 Content-Type: image/jpeg   ==>     - END_STREAM
	 Content-Length: 123                + END_HEADERS
	                                      :status = 200
	 {binary data}                        content-type = image/jpeg
	                                      content-length = 123
	
	                                  DATA
	                                    + END_STREAM
	                                  {binary data}
An informational response using a 1xx status code other than 101 is transmitted as a HEADERS frame, followed by zero or more CONTINUATION frames.

Trailing header fields are sent as a header block after both the request or response header block and all the DATA frames have been sent. The HEADERS frame starting the trailers header block has the END_STREAM flag set.

The following example includes both a 100 (Continue) status code, which is sent in response to a request containing a "100-continue" token in the Expect header field, and trailing header fields:

	 HTTP/1.1 100 Continue            HEADERS
	 Extension-Field: bar       ==>     - END_STREAM
	                                    + END_HEADERS
	                                      :status = 100
	                                      extension-field = bar
	
	 HTTP/1.1 200 OK                  HEADERS
	 Content-Type: image/jpeg   ==>     - END_STREAM
	 Transfer-Encoding: chunked         + END_HEADERS
	 Trailer: Foo                         :status = 200
	                                      content-length = 123
	 123                                  content-type = image/jpeg
	 {binary data}                        trailer = Foo
	 0
	 Foo: bar                         DATA
	                                    - END_STREAM
	                                  {binary data}
	
	                                  HEADERS
	                                    + END_STREAM
	                                    + END_HEADERS
	                                      foo = bar
