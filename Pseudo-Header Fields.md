While HTTP/1.x used the message start-line (see [RFC7230], Section 3.1) to convey the target URI, the method of the request, and the status code for the response, HTTP/2 uses special pseudo-header fields beginning with ':' character (ASCII 0x3a) for this purpose.

Pseudo-header fields are not HTTP header fields. Endpoints MUST NOT generate pseudo-header fields other than those defined in this document.

Pseudo-header fields are only valid in the context in which they are defined. Pseudo-header fields defined for requests MUST NOT appear in responses; pseudo-header fields defined for responses MUST NOT appear in requests. Pseudo-header fields MUST NOT appear in trailers. Endpoints MUST treat a request or response that contains undefined or invalid pseudo-header fields as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).

All pseudo-header fields MUST appear in the header block before regular header fields. Any request or response that contains a pseudo-header field that appears in a header block after a regular header field MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).
