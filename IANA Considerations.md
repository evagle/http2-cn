A string for identifying HTTP/2 is entered into the "Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established in [TLS-ALPN].

This document establishes a registry for frame types, settings, and error codes. These new registries appear in the new "Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 (HTTP/2) Parameters" section.

This document registers the HTTP2-Settings header field for use in HTTP; it also registers the 421 (Misdirected Request) status code.

This document registers the PRI method for use in HTTP to avoid collisions with the connection preface (Section 3.5).
