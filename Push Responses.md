After sending the PUSH_PROMISE frame, the server can begin delivering the pushed response as a response (Section 8.1.2.4) on a server-initiated stream that uses the promised stream identifier. The server uses this stream to transmit an HTTP response, using the same sequence of frames as defined in Section 8.1. This stream becomes "half-closed" to the client (Section 5.1) after the initial HEADERS frame is sent.

Once a client receives a PUSH_PROMISE frame and chooses to accept the pushed response, the client SHOULD NOT issue any requests for the promised response until after the promised stream has closed.

If the client determines, for any reason, that it does not wish to receive the pushed response from the server or if the server takes too long to begin sending the promised response, the client can send a RST_STREAM frame, using either the CANCEL or REFUSED_STREAM code and referencing the pushed stream's identifier.

A client can use the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting to limit the number of responses that can be concurrently pushed by a server. Advertising a SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS value of zero disables server push by preventing the server from creating the necessary streams. This does not prohibit a server from sending PUSH_PROMISE frames; clients need to reset any promised streams that are not wanted.

Clients receiving a pushed response MUST validate that either the server is authoritative (see Section 10.1) or the proxy that provided the pushed response is configured for the corresponding request. For example, a server that offers a certificate for only the example.com DNS-ID or Common Name is not permitted to push a response for https://www.example.org/doc.

The response for a PUSH_PROMISE stream begins with a HEADERS frame, which immediately puts the stream into the "half-closed (remote)" state for the server and "half-closed (local)" state for the client, and ends with a frame bearing END_STREAM, which places the stream in the "closed" state.

+	Note: The client never sends a frame with the END_STREAM flag for a server push.
